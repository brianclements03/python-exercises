    "# Working with Lists of Dictionaries\n",

    "    - Order matters because lists use a numeric index to access\n",
    "    - Any ordered list from the real word could be stored as a list in Python\n",
    "    - Lists can hold any data type, including other lists and commonly dictionaries.\n",
    "    - `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or `[\"this\", \"that\", \"the other\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries are like labeled lists with keys and values.\n",
    "    - Each key is like is own new variable name (kinda)\n",
    "    - We access values in dictionaries from their given key\n",
    "    - A real world example of a dictionary would be the nutritional facts for grocery items.\n",
    "    - The keys we see are \"calories\", \"carbs\", etc.. and the values are the appropriate values\n",
    "    - `{\"first_name\": \"Ryan\", \"last_name\": \"Orsinger\", \"favorite_language\": \"Python\"}`\n",
